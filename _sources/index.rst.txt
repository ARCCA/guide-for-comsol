How to use COMSOL on the Hawk supercomputer.
==================================================
`COMSOL <https://www.comsol.com/comsol-multiphysics>`_ is *a simulation platform that
encompasses all of the steps in the modeling workflow â€” from defining geometries, 
material properties, and the physics that describe specific phenomena to solving and
postprocessing models for producing accurate and trustworthy results*.

Here you will find instructions about how to run COMSOL Multiphysics on ARCCA's HPC
cluster *Hawk* both using the Command Line Interface (CLI) and COMSOL's *Cluster
Computing* feature. The objective is to provide you with options that will allow you 
to adopt the use of HPC in your work to help you reduce the time required to run
demanding simulations and/or scale up existing models.
